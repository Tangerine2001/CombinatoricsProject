Combinatorics Project Readme
By: Daniel Shen and Max Tang

CombintoricsProject.exe will open a Windows Form and an instance of the console.
To stop running the program, close the CONSOLE. Closing only the windows form will
not stop running the file. This also means that the program will only run on a
Windows operating System. MacOS, iOS, and Linux are not compatible.

Graph Type and Version with corresponding pictures are located under the
GraphPictures folder.

You can tell the algorithm is running when you have clicked a button corresponding
to which algorithm you wanted to run is and it's still highlighted blue.

For the purposes of being more efficient in programming, the complete graph on
five vertices and the graph on 100 vertices are called Type 10, Version 1 and
Version 2, respectively.

WARNING!!

Some graphs will cause certain algorithms to break. If you try running these programs,
the window will break and the only way to stop is to close the console.
The graphs are listed below:

For Random Hamiltonian:
Type 5 Version 2
Type 6 Versions 1 & 2
Type 10 Version 2 (The 100 vertex graph)

For General Hamiltonian:
Type 5 Version 2
Type 6 Versions 1 & 2
Type 9 Versions 1 & 2
Type 10 Version 2
